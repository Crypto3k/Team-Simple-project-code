Needs: 
We have 4 methods for sorting, 1 for listing the total value of coin collection, we need 4 more methods to do, 3 of them being difficult because I don't think he will count sorting as difficult.
Sort by Quality, Mint, Denomination, Year
List total of denominations
List all coins of particular Quality, Mint, Denomination, Year
Add methods for sorting

Finished: 
Coin.java (pic with proof in folder)

Added to: 
CoinArray (added listeners for sorting, cleaned up unused code)

1 method for displaying total amount of coins from each mint
